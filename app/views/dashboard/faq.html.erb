  <p>Networking is difficult. Our platform suggests like-minded professionals that you should meet, and you can decide if you would like an introduction in less than 10 seconds.</p>
  <h4 class="text-info">How does it work?</h4>
  <p>Once per week, we will suggest a potential match (you will receive an email notification). Upon login, you can view your potential match's profile and decide if you would like an introduction. If both people are interested, then we will put you in touch via email.</p>
  <h4 class="text-info">How are matches created?</h4>
  <p>We have an algorithm that evaluates several criteria, including city, industry interests, number of shared LinkedIn connections, work experience, and education.</p>
  <h4 class="text-info">What are you storing from LinkedIn?</h4>
  <p>We pull down basic information such as name, work experience, education, profile picture, and your email address. We also look at your list of LinkedIn connections to make sure that we don't match you with someone that you are already a first degree connection with.</p>
  <h4 class="text-info">Who can see my information?</h4>
  <p>Your potential matches can see what is on your profile page. Your email address is only shared if both people express interest in meeting.</p>
